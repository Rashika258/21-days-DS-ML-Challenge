    "The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A supervised machine learning algorithm (as opposed to an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) is one that relies on labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data.\n",
    "Imagine a computer is a child, we are its supervisor (e.g. parent, guardian, or teacher), and we want the child (computer) to learn what a pig looks like. We will show the child several different pictures, some of which are pigs and the rest could be pictures of anything (cats, dogs, etc).\n",
    "When we see a pig, we shout “pig!” When it’s not a pig, we shout “no, not pig!” After doing this several times with the child, we show them a picture and ask “pig?” and they will correctly (most of the time) say “pig!” or “no, not pig!” depending on what the picture is. That is supervised machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning algorithms are used to solve classification or regression problems.\n",
    "A classification problem has a discrete value as its output. For example, “likes pineapple on pizza” and “does not like pineapple on pizza” are discrete. There is no middle ground. The analogy above of teaching a child to identify a pig is another example of a classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A regression problem has a real number (a number with a decimal point) as its output. For example, we could use the data in the table below to estimate someone’s weight given their height.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An unsupervised machine learning algorithm makes use of input data without any labels —in other words, no teacher (label) telling the child (computer) when it is right or when it has made a mistake so that it can self-correct.\n",
    "Unlike supervised learning that tries to learn a function that will allow us to make predictions given some new unlabeled data, unsupervised learning tries to learn the basic structure of the data to give us more insight into the data."

    "To select the K that’s right for your data, we run the KNN algorithm several times with different values of K and choose the K that reduces the number of errors we encounter while maintaining the algorithm’s ability to accurately make predictions when it’s given data it hasn’t seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we decrease the value of K to 1, our predictions become less stable. Just think for a minute, imagine K=1 and we have a query point surrounded by several reds and one green, but the green is the single nearest neighbor. Reasonably, we would think the query point is most likely red, but because K=1, KNN incorrectly predicts that the query point is green.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inversely, as we increase the value of K, our predictions become more stable due to majority voting / averaging, and thus, more likely to make more accurate predictions (up to a certain point). Eventually, we begin to witness an increasing number of errors. It is at this point we know we have pushed the value of K too far.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where we are taking a majority vote (e.g. picking the mode in a classification problem) among labels, we usually make K an odd number to have a tiebreaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no need to build a model, tune several parameters, or make additional assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression, and search (as we will see in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "The algorithm gets significantly slower as the number of examples and/or predictors/independent variables increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN’s main disadvantage of becoming significantly slower as the volume of data increases makes it an impractical choice in environments where predictions need to be made rapidly. Moreover, there are faster algorithms that can produce more accurate classification and regression results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, provided you have sufficient computing resources to speedily handle the data you are using to make predictions, KNN can still be useful in solving problems that have solutions that depend on identifying similar objects. An example of this is using the KNN algorithm in recommender systems, an application of KNN-search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender Systems\n",
    "At scale, this would look like recommending products on Amazon, articles on Medium, movies on Netflix, or videos on YouTube. Although, we can be certain they all use more efficient means of making recommendations due to the enormous volume of data they process.\n",
